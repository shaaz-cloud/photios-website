                    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
                    <p>We understand the serious implications of data security and take extensive measures to ensure Your data and information is secured. We take extensive technical, and legal measures to safeguard Your personal data. The Website uses a reliable SSL certificate to ensure Your personal data is not misused in any manner whatsoever. We use SSL encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browser windows during SSL transactions that involve debit/credit cards and other forms of payment. In case We ask You for Your debit/credit card number for payment or for verification purposes, the same will be SSL encrypted. The information You provide will be stored securely on Our servers. Once You choose to store or enter Your debit/credit card number, it will not be displayed back to You in its entirety when You retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, You will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your debit/credit card number.</p>
                    <p>We also work with third party service providers/professionals who provide services on Our behalf or to Us. We enter into agreements with such third-party service providers and professionals to ensure complete security and safety of the User information. Such third-party service providers do not have any independent right to the information provided by Us to them.</p>
                    <p>Our employees and data processors, who have access to, and are associated with the processing of sensitive personal data or information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of every User’s personal information or sensitive personal data and information. We have put in place procedures and technologies as per good industry practices and in accordance with the applicable laws, to maintain security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Any third-party data processor to which We transfer Personal Data shall have to agree to comply with those procedures and policies, or put in place adequate measures on their own.</p>
                    <p>You shall be liable to indemnify Us due to any loss suffered by Us due to such unauthorized use of Your account and password. Note that We make all User information accessible to Our employees, agents or partners and third parties only on a need-to-know basis and bind only its employees to strict confidentiality obligations. However, We are not responsible for the confidentiality, security or distribution of Your personal information by Our partners and third parties outside the scope of Our agreement with such partners and third parties.</p>

                    <p>We may need to request specific information from You to help Us confirm Your identity and ensure Your right to access Your personal data (or to exercise any of Your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
